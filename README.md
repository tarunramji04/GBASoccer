How the Game Works
- The purpose of the game is to score a goal before the timer (displayed on the screen) runs out and without
colliding into a moving defender.
- The defender moves in the same direction as the ball, but can only cover half as much ground.
- The ball or defenders will not move beyond the boundaries of the field (marked by black lines).

Controls
- Click enter from the start screen to play easy mode.
- Click z from the start screen to play hard mode.
- Use arrows to move the ball.
- Click backspace at any time to restart the game.
